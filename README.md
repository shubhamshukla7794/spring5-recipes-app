```
git clone https://github.com/shubhamshukla7794/spring5-recipes-app.git
cd spring5-recipes-app
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

## Working with Recipe App in your IDE

### Prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Recipe App uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is automatically exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` url.
